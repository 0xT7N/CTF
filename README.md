# CTF challenge name : Hammered
at the first we have to know something about Web Server for investigation 
<br> a) /var/log/auth.log â€“ Contains system authorization information, including user logins and authentication machinsm that were used.
<br> b) /var/log/apache/access.log is a log file that records all events related to client applications and user access to a resource on a computer.
<br> c) '/var/log/dmesg' file provides a snapshot of the kernel messages at boot time 
<br> d) /var/log/daemon.log show the stack trace or the path to a file containing the stack trace if it was logged to a file.
<br> e) /var/log/apt folder has the history.log log file that keeps all the package installation and removal information
# Q1 Which service did the attackers use to gain access to the system?
<br> the only log file will help us to know which service attacker used for gain access (auth.log) 
<br> because it Contains system authorization information, including user logins and authentication machinsm that were used.
<br> we will use this command to gain more info about it
<br> **cat auth.log | grep "Failed"**
<br> the attacker was been using brute force attack to gain access using **ssh service**

# Q2 What is the operating system version of the targeted system?
<br> in this **Q** we can recognition about the operating system with two ways 
<br> **first one** we will check dmesg file **( dmesg' file provides a snapshot of the kernel messages at boot time )**
<br> with command line **cat dmesg | less**
<br> we will see the the operating system version is **4.2.4-1ubuntu3**
![2](https://github.com/0xT7N/CTF/assets/75274517/ab8c46e9-d882-4deb-b2d5-f8464c95810a)
<br> **second one** we will check **kern.log**
<br> with command line **cat kern.log | less**
<br> we will see the the operating system version is **4.2.4-1ubuntu3**
![3](https://github.com/0xT7N/CTF/assets/75274517/72dd7471-dca1-49d6-9e0f-a16a58e45f05)

# Q3 What is the name of the compromised account?
<br> in this **Q** we need to know which accound was compromised so only log file will help us is **auth.log** because it 
<br>Contains system authorization information, including user logins and authentication machinsm that were used. 
<br> we will use command line **cat auth.log | grep 'Accepted password'** 
<br> so **root** account was compromised 
<br> how we detect it if we go back to this command **cat auth.log | grep "Failed"** 
<br> we will see the ip **219.150.161.20** 
<br>At Apr 19 05:38:37 gain Failed password more than one time that mean the attacker was been using brute force attack to gain access until 
<br> did it and compromised root account At Apr 19 05:55:20

# Q4 Consider that each unique IP represents a different attacker. How many attackers were able to get access to the system?
<br> we need to know how many attackers were able to get access to the system so we need to know how many 
<br> ip get **Failed password for root** Then get **Accepted password for root**
<br> with comparing to commands we will get the number of attackers were able to get access to the system
<br> cat auth.log | grep 'Failed password for root' | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c
<br> cat auth.log | grep 'Accepted password for root' | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c
<br> we will see **6**

# Q5 Which attacker's IP address successfully logged into the system the most number of times
# Q6 How many requests were sent to the Apache Server?
<br> to know how many requsests were sent to the apache server
<br> we will find it inside access.log because it is  **a log file that records all events related to client applications and user access to a resource on a computer.**
<br> **wc -l** will count number of lines then we get number of requestes 
<br> command line **wc -l www-access.log**

# Q7 How many rules have been added to the firewall?
<br> command line **cat auth.log | grep 'iptable'**
![10](https://github.com/0xT7N/CTF/assets/75274517/a9911f4a-ae42-44e2-96c7-5f170e200953)
 # Q8 One of the downloaded files to the target system is a scanning tool. Provide the tool name.
 <br> log file will help us in this **Q** to know which tool downloaded is term.log
 <br> /var/log/apt **folder has the history.log log file that keeps all the package installation and removal information**
<br> we will use this command **cat term.log | grep -A 5 -B 5 'install'**
<br> **nmap** is most popular scanning tools
![11](https://github.com/0xT7N/CTF/assets/75274517/dd6b0a54-a989-4412-af0c-d09a8a9b4649)

# Q9 When was the last login from the attacker with IP 219.150.161.20? Format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM
<br> using this command **cat auth.log | grep 'Accepted password for root'** will know last login
<br> but we will not see the year get it from **auth.log properties**

# Q10 The database displayed two warning messages, provide the most important and dangerous one.
<br> data about database will stored in **daemon.log** file
<br> with command line **cat daemon.log | grep 'mysql' | grep 'WARNING'**
![14](https://github.com/0xT7N/CTF/assets/75274517/07d102df-2384-4bf2-9fe0-cd8489724947)
# Q11 Multiple accounts were created on the target system. Which one was created on Apr 26 04:43:15?
<br> **cat auth.log | grep 'Apr 26 04:43:15'**
![15](https://github.com/0xT7N/CTF/assets/75274517/536fd009-f24f-4f6b-b794-5d45b4cb2df6)
# Q12 Few attackers were using a proxy to run their scans. What is the corresponding user-agent used by this proxy?
<br>The HTTP CONNECT method starts two-way communications with the requested resource. It can be used to open a tunnel.
